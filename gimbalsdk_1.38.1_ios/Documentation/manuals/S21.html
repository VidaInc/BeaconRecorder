</div>
<div class="span11">

<h2>Intended Use</h2>

<h3>What is the Gimbal Series 21 Proximity Beacon?</h3>

<p>
    The Gimbal Series 21 Proximity Beacon (the 'Beacon') is a small, battery-powered device which transmits
    a Bluetooth&#153; <i>Smart</i> / low-energy signal that can be detected by other devices (e.g.,
    smartphones or other devices capable of receiving the signal). This signal provides the identity of the
    beacon as well as other telemetry information to the receiving device (e.g., battery level and
    temperature).<br><br>

    The Beacon works by periodically waking up, transmitting this signal via short-range radio (Bluetooth
    Smart/LE) and then returning to a low-power state. The Beacon has no user interface (UI), cellular or
    GPS capabilities. The beacon's identity is encoded within the signal it transmits and includes a
    sub-segment device type.
</p>

<h3>Important safety instructions for your Beacon</h3>

<p>
    <img src=../images/warning.png><b>WARNING - CHOKING HAZARD:</b> Small parts. Not for children under 3
    years of age. This product comes with AA alkaline batteries.<br><br>
    <img src=../images/warning.png><b>CAUTION:</b> Do not connect improperly, charge or dispose of in fire.
    Battery may explore or leak. Please visit <a href="http://gimbal.com/legal/regulatory">http://gimbal.com/legal/regulatory</a>
    for more information.<br><br>

    If the battery leaks:
<ul>
    <li>Do not allow the leaking fluid to come in contact with skin or clothing. If contact has already
        occurred, flush the affected area immediately with clean water and seek medical advice.
    </li>
    <li>Do not allow the leaking fluid to come in contact with eyes. If contact has already occurred, DO NOT
        rub; rinse with clean water immediately and seek medical advice.
    </li>
    <li>Take extra precautions to keep a leaking battery away from fire, as there is a danger of ignition or
        explosion.
    </li>
    <li>Vapor generated from burning batteries may irritate eyes, skin, and throat. If inhalation occurs,
        move to a well-ventilated area immediately and seek medical advice.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>


<h2>Using Your Beacon</h2>

<h3>Powering Your Beacon</h3>

<p>
    Open the Beacon by pressing the two latches on opposite sides of the beacon at the same time with one
    hand and while holding the front part of the beacon with the other hand. Once the Beacon has been
    opened, move the small power switch located between the two sets of batteries from the 'Off' position to
    the 'On' position.
</p>

<h3>Replacing the batteries in your Beacon</h3>

<p>
    The Beacon has four (4) AA alkaline batteries which will typically power the Beacon for approximately 16
    months but depends on configuration and environment. To replace the batteries:
<ol>
    <li>Switch the power switch to the 'Off' position.</li>
    <li>Remove and properly dispose of the old batteries.</li>
    <li>Install four (4) new AA alkaline batteries.</li>
    <li>Switch the power switch to the 'On' position.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Activating your Beacon</h3>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>Locate your Beacon's ID (of the format XXXX-XXXXX or similar)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>On the exterior label of the Beacon's box, or</li>
        <li>On the Beacon's inside label between the two sets of batteries</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://manager.gimbal.com/">https://manager.gimbal.com/</a> and create a Gimbal
        Developer Account if necessary
    </li>
    <li>Login to your account and follow the links to Activate a Beacon</li>
    <li>Enter your Beacon's ID in the field provided</li>
    <li>The beacon is now associated with your account and can be viewed from your application or via the
        Gimbal Beacon Manager application available for download.
    </li>

<h2>Regulatory Information</h2>

<h3>Safety and wireless devices</h3>

<p>
    Scientific research on wireless devices and radio frequency ("RF") energy has been conducted worldwide
    for many years, and continues. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
    Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set policies and procedures for wireless devices. The FDA issued
    a website publication on health issues related to usage of cell phones where it states, "The scientific
    community at large believes that the weight of the scientific evidence does not show an association
    between exposure to RF from cell phones and adverse health outcomes." Still, the scientific community
    does recommend conducting additional research to address gaps in knowledge. That research is being
    conducted around the world, and the FDA continues to monitor developments in this field. You can access
    the FDA website at http://www.fda.gov (Under "C" in the subject index, select Cell Phones > Research.).
    You can also contact the FDA toll free at (888) 463-6332 or (888) INFO-FDA. The FCC issued its own
    website publication stating that "there is no scientific evidence that proves that wireless telephone
    usage can lead to cancer or other problems, including headaches, dizziness, or memory loss." The
    publication is available at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/cellular.html or through the FCC at (888) 225 5322 or
    (888) CALL-FCC. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) states that concerns about the potential health
    effects of using cellular phones - "and specifically the suggestion that using a cell phone may increase
    a person's risk of developing brain cancer - are not supported by a growing body of research on the
    subject." You can access NCI's review of the research at
    http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2008/092308/page7 .
</p>

<h3>Can I minimize my RF exposure?</h3>

<p>
    If you are concerned about RF, there are several simple steps you can take to minimize your RF exposure.
    You can minimize usage of the device near the body. You can also place more distance between your body
    and the source of the RF, as the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. Wireless devices
    marketed in the United States are required to meet safety requirements regardless of whether they are
    used against the head or against the body.

The Gimbal Series 21 Proximity Beacon has been tested to the limits for a Class B digital device, according
to Part 15 of the FCC rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful
interference in a residential installation. The Beacon uses and radiates radio frequency energy and if not
installed and used according to instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications or be
interfered with. There is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular
installation.<br><br>

If the Beacon does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined
switching the Beacon's power switch to the ‘off' position, try to correct the interference by taking one or
more of the following actions:
<ul>
    <li>Increase the distance between the Beacon and radio or television receiver, or</li>
    <li>Consult the dealer where you bought your radio/TV or an experienced radio/TV technician.</li>
</ul>

If the Beacon is being interfered with try to correct the interference by taking the following actions:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure that the Beacon is no closer than 10 ft. (3 m) of a wireless access point, microwave oven,
        or 2.4 GHz cordless phone, and/or
    </li>
    <li>Increase the distance between the Beacon and any other electronic equipment by moving the Beacon.
    </li>
</ul>

<B>CAUTION</B> The Beacon should not be used in airplanes, hospitals, or locations where cellular telephones
and other electronic devices are prohibited.
